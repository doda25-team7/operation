Due to sickness and being blocked by the completion of the previous assignment couldn't finish it.

- Tobias: https://github.com/doda25-team7/infrastructure/pull/4
Also attempted to fix the problems with 1.3 and 1.4. 
However, ran into some problems with compatabiility with Linux due too restricted host-only network for virtualbox and an issue with the run join command which also seemed to happen only on my end (might also be linux related but no confirmed)
Will be adding the fixes to these problems to the readme beginning next week.
Also made a beginning making sure the code adheres to the A2 tips in 1.6: local provisioning and avoiding shell command.
